In my last blog post, I mentioned that I would write more frequently. However, I didn't follow through because I'm often too lazy and prefer to be a couch potato after work. I know this isn't good for me, but it's hard to break the habit. Nonetheless, here I am, writing a blog! And I believe that's a positive step.

Reflecting on work, I've realized something important over the past few days. Keeping a daily work record has been incredibly helpful. At the end of each day, I document what I did, what I learned, how I felt, and what I should do the next day. Then, the following day, I transfer my notes about what needs to be done to the new day's record. This way, I don't have to spend time figuring out what I accomplished yesterday and what I need to do today. Additionally, when I feel unproductive, I can look back at my records to boost my confidence and reassure myself that I'm not slacking off. I think this is a beneficial habit, and I plan to continue it. (By the way, I write these records in English to improve my English!)

Another thing I want to share is a conversation I had with my host. I asked her if she continues learning in her spare time because I often feel unmotivated after work. She shared some valuable insights. First, it is common for us to keep learning throughout our careers. However, it's okay not to have expertise in every domain. When faced with a new project or team, we might need to learn new things, and that's perfectly fine. It's essential to inform our manager when we're unfamiliar with certain knowledge and need time to learn it. Then, we can acquire the necessary skills and perform our tasks. Second, she told me she utilizes her commute time to read emails, ensuring she doesn't waste time during transportation. She considers the time on the MRT as an extension of her work hours. I think this is a great idea, but I can't do it right now because I don't have a company phone to access emails. However, I would try this in the future.

Last weekend, I watched an interesting anime called "The Apothecary Diaries" (Ëó•Â∏´Â∞ëÂ•≥ÁöÑÁç®Ë™û). It's about a girl servant in the palace who is obsessed with poison and medicine. She is intelligent and helps solve many mysterious cases in the palace. I really enjoy the chemistry between the two main characters, the girl servant and an influential eunuch. The eunuch constantly teases the servant, who in turn sees him as a caterpillar. This anime is one of my top three favorites this year, and I highly recommend it if you enjoy funny and mysterious anime.

That's all for today. I will try to write more blogs in the future.(or not, haha) Bye! üëã
