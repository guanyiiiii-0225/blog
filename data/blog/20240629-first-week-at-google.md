Hi everyone, this is Zoe. I started my SWE internship at Google this weeküéâ, and I was surprised to find that there are lots of foreigners at Google. Moreover, there is a Korean colleague on our team, which means that our team needs to communicate in English both during lunch and in meetings. This is a huge challenge for me because I'm not good at speaking English, but I think this is a valuable opportunity for me to practice. In order to improve my English quickly, I want to write my blogs in English. That's why I'm using English in this blog!

Speaking of Google, the restaurant may be the most appealing feature here. There is a variety of food at Google. I love breakfast the most! I always have a cup of freshly squeezed juice and some fried eggs. I think breakfast is the best meal of the day. For lunch, we can choose to eat hamburgers, noodles (which change daily), and buffet. The most impressive thing is that we have H√§agen-Dazs ice cream. Although it is in small cups, it is still too much for me, so I don't have it too frequently. I think the food at Google is quite healthy since there are always several vegetables and meats like fish and chicken. I can get all the nutrition I need here.

The building I work in is big and new. We have two game rooms and other facilities. There is a Taiko no Tatsujin game(Â§™ÈºìÈÅî‰∫∫) in one of the game rooms near my seat. I noticed one of my colleagues also likes to play Taiko no Tatsujin, and now we are partners! Speaking of my colleagues, I think they are very nice and friendly. I really enjoy having lunch with them!

I think I'll stop here for now. I hope I can write one to two blogs a week to record my life (maybe not all about life at Google). Wish me luck!
