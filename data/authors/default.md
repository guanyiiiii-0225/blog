Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Zoe. I studied Information Management at National Taiwan University and will be starting my master's program in Computer Science at NTU this year. I had an internship at KKCompany in 2022, which was a great opportunity for me to work at KKBOX, my childhood dream company. And it allowed me to explore the music industry, which is wonderful✨✨✨

Currently, I'm exploring my path as an engineer and figuring out which direction to specialize in. But one thing remains the same: my eagerness to grow. So, I want to use this platform to share my life and some technical notes. Feel free to interact with me!
